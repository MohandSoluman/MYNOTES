Repository Pattern: Ensures separation of data access logic from business logic.
Dependency Injection: Improves testability and flexibility.
Socket.IO: Supports real-time communication between users.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error management throughout the application.
Auditing: Tracks changes and actions across the app.
Payment Integration: Built-in payment gateway for transactions.
Winston Logger: Provides configurable logging for monitoring and debugging.
User Management: Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
Sequelize ORM: Manages data modeling and queries.
PostgreSQL: Database of choice for storing structured data.
Docker & Docker Compose: Containerized environment setup for easy deployment.
Swagger: Documentation and testing interface for the APIs.
Security Best Practices: Includes measures like helmet, rate limiting, CORS, and others.
Authentication & Authorization: Ensures secure access control.
Streams: Efficiently handles and processes file data.
Data Visualization: Displays data insights in visual formats.
Unit Testing: Maintains code quality and functionality.
Architecture
The app uses a modular architecture that ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for scalability and ease of testing. Key architectural patterns include:

Repository Pattern: Manages data access in a centralized manner.
Dependency Injection: Promotes flexibility by allowing dependencies to be injected at runtime.
Middleware: Custom middleware for logging, error handling, and security practices.
Technologies Used
Node.js
Express (framework for building APIs)
Socket.IO (for real-time communication)
Sequelize ORM (for data modeling and PostgreSQL interaction)
Docker & Docker Compose (for containerization and environment management)

Jest/Mocha (for unit testing)
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js v14+
Docker and Docker Compose
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd notes-app
Install dependencies:

bash

API Documentation
The app uses Swagger for API documentation. Once the server is running, access the documentation at:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:<PORT>/api-docs
This documentation provides details on all API endpoints, including routes, parameters, and responses.

Testing
Unit tests ensure code reliability and quality. Run the tests with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Security Best Practices
The app includes security measures to protect user data and app resources, including:

Helmet for setting secure HTTP headers
CORS for controlling access
Rate Limiting to mitigate DDoS attacks
Input Validation with custom sanitizers
